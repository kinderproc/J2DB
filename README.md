J2DB is a service for generating a PostgreSQL, MySQL or MongoDb database based on JSON. 
The service also supports loading data in csv format. Interaction with the service occurs via API. JSON is fed to the 
input, with a data structure, and the user receives settings for connecting to the database with the corresponding
structure and generated data.
